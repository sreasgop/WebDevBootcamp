# Variables:  A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value that we can refer to and use when required.
There are 4 ways to declare a Javascript Variable:
1. Using var:
 The var keyword has been part of JavaScript since its inception.
 Variables defined with var are not block-scoped, and have function scope or global scope.
 Variables defined with var can be reassigned within their scope, and can also be redeclared within the same scope.
 var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning that the variable is accessible throughout the entire function or global scope, regardless of where it is declared.

2. Using let: 
 The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
 Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.
 Variables defined with let must be declared before use.
 Variables defined with let have block scope.

3. Using const:
 The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
 Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
 Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
 Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

4. Using nothing: We can also create a variable in javascript without declaring it and directly initializing a value to it. This is known as an implicit declaration or an undeclared variable.
