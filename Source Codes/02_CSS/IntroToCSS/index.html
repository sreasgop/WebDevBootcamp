    <p> CSS is among the core langauges of the open web and is standardized across web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1 or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or CSS4; rather everything is now just CSS with individual CSS modules having different version numbers.</p>
